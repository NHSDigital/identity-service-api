# SBOM & Vulnerability Scanning Automation

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), scan for vulnerabilities, and produce package inventory reports.

All reports are named with the repository name for easy identification.

## Features

SBOM Generation: Uses Syft to generate an SPDX JSON SBOM.
SBOM Merging: Merges SBOMs for multiple tools if needed.
SBOM to CSV: Converts SBOM JSON to a CSV report.
Vulnerability Scanning: Uses Grype to scan the SBOM for vulnerabilities and outputs a CSV report.
Package Inventory: Extracts a simple package list (name, type, version) as a CSV.
Artifacts: All reports are uploaded as workflow artifacts with the repository name in the filename.

## Workflow Overview

The main workflow is defined in .github/workflows/sbom.yml

## Scripts

scripts/create-sbom.sh
Generates an SBOM for the repo and for specified tools, merging them as needed.
scripts/update-sbom.py
Merges additional SBOMs into the main SBOM.
.github/scripts/sbom_json_to_csv.py
Converts the SBOM JSON to a detailed CSV report.
.github/scripts/grype_json_to_csv.py
Converts Grypeâ€™s vulnerability scan JSON output to a CSV report.
Output columns: REPO, NAME, INSTALLED, FIXED-IN, TYPE, VULNERABILITY, SEVERITY
.github/scripts/sbom_packages_to_csv.py
Extracts a simple package inventory from the SBOM.
Output columns: name, type, version
